# vocabulary_notebook

This is my free time simple scripts, and also a tool that helps me a lot in remembering new vocabulary more effectively

I NAME IT IS "LY WORD"!

# Introducing

Firstly, it's not a dictionary, it is a notebook instead. 

The main functions of my notebook are note words, review words, smart look-up.

## Note words ->put the words in context:

_In my attempt to learn vocabulary, I realize that a good way to do it well is basing on their example, not the translating from vocabulary to its meaning._ 
**In my notebook, to note words, we first need to write an example and then choose the words in that sentence that needs to remember.** This change of how we note something makes we concern more on the real-life situation of new words:

***And when showed, the word will be AUTOMATICALLY grouped to its simplest word form, and attached to its pronunciation. All data for this is based on the CMU dictionary from SourceForge: http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict***

## Review vocabulary ->the mix between English and Vietnamese:

This way is known as how Jews people learn English to remember vocabulary longer, and the context of it.

***Also, the printed question is random and THEN BASES ON how many times we answer this question wrong before and how many times it is printed!***

## Look-up->everywhere even if it is misspelled

The word of the phrase will be searched on the whole that includes the vocabulary, example, meaning, and note. It also shows the result if the keyword is wrong spelled for a little.

*In the red box, the first figure is the number of times you answer right this question before, the second one is the number of times it is printed as question*
